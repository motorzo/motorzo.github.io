                <strong>Liability:</strong>
                <br>
                <br>

                The information, recommendations or services provided to you on or through the Website, the Service and
                the Application is for general information purposes only and does not constitute advice. MotorZo will

                l The vehicle being requested to serviced is legally owned by you and you will be able to produce
                ownership documents when asked for. If you are not the owner you should have a authority letter from the
                owner while making the transaction for the service. MotorZo has the rights to report to concerned law
                enforcement authorities if MotorZo has the reason to believe that the vehicle in question is not legally
                owned by you.

                l That the charges towards maintenance services specified in the bill are paid by you

                l That some amount of fuel is utilized in the process of pick up and delivering the Vehicle from service
                station to your place.

                l Estimated Quotes for the approved job might vary by 10% in the final invoice.

                l That in the event of any major damages caused to the vehicle while in the custody of service station,
                the service station shall be held responsible for the same and MotorZo shall provide you all sort of
                assistance required in obtaining any compensation.

                l That in the event of theft of Your Vehicle while in the custody of service station, MotorZo shall not
                be held responsible for such loss and the compensation for such loss shall be provided solely by the
                service station as determined by negotiation between you and service station, and MotorZo shall provide
                you all sort of assistance required in obtaining such compensation.

                l That in the event of malfunctioning of a part/spare under the warranty period, which is replaced or
                added to the vehicle as a part of maintenance work, the said part will be replaced or repaired by the
                service station at free of cost. But minimal labour charge for such replacement might be charged.

                l That the said part/spare under the warranty period, if physically damaged, when it is in the custody
                of vehicle owner will not be liable for any warranty.

                l Neither MotorZo or you shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure in performance under the
                terms and conditions, other than payment obligations, arising out of a cause beyond its control and
                without its fault or negligence. Such causes may include, but are not limited to fires, floods,
                earthquakes, strikes, unavailability of necessary utilities, blackouts, acts of God, acts of declared or
                undeclared war, acts of regulatory agencies, or natural disasters.
                <br>
                <br>

                <strong>Payments, refunds and cancellations:</strong>
                <br>
                <br>

                Some services made available for booking to you include the opportunity to make payments facilitated
                through our service. Such payments will be made using trusted third party payment gateways. By making a
                payment through MotorZo, you undertake that the credit or debit card details, or third party wallet
                login credentials that you provide are for your own credit or debit card, or wallet account, and that
                you have sufficient funds to make the payment for the services booked.

                We reserve the right to alter prices or services or cease to list services at any time, without prior
                notice or warning. The total price shown for services is inclusive of the items described for that
                service and may not include additional services found to be required at the time of availing your
                service. In such a case the service provider will discuss any change in scope with you and additional
                agreements or payments where required are made between you and the service provider with no liability to
                MotorZo.

                In cases where a form of online payment is offered and selected you must complete the payment in full to
                successfully make the booking. Payment details provided are not stored by MotorZo and are encrypted by
                the payment provider selected to ensure security.

                If you decide to cancel your appointment, you may do at any time, preferably by phone, quoting your
                order number, or in the mobile application. Any such appointment can also be cancelled by the service
                vendor or MotorZo and will be communicated to the customer over phone, e-mail or mobile application.
                Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made before the car has reached the vendor
                location. Cancellation request will not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
                vendors and they have initiated the services.
                Any refund, if applicable can be claimed only after service order cancellation. In case of any payment
                made along with service booking, the refund will be made only if the cancellation is done before
                initiating the services by the Service Station.
